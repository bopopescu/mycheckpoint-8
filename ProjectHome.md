_mycheckpoint_ is an open source monitoring utility for MySQL, with strong emphasis on user accessibility to monitored data.

It is SQL oriented: charts, reports and advances metrics are generated on the fly with views. There is no need for an external program to diagnose the data. In fact, _mycheckpointâ€™s_ main duty is to to a one-time creation of a special purpose schema.

Recording of data is performed via a single INSERT command, which takes measurements from GLOBAL VARIABLES, GLOBAL STATUS, MASTER STATUS and SLAVE STATUS. There is no requirement that this measurement is taken by _mycheckpoint_ itself. In addition, _mycheckpoint_ allows for [custom queries](http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation/custom-monitoring), the results of which are aggregated along with all other measurements.

Once the data is recorded, it is as easy to get complex presentations and diagnostics, such as [charting](http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation/generating-google-charts) and [reporting](http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation/generating-human-reports), as it is to issue [simple SELECT](http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation/querying-for-data) statements. You can even get [HTML reporting](http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation/generating-html-reports) pages (see [sample](http://code.openark.org/forge/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/mycheckpoint-report-brief-169.html)). [Detecting parameters change](http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation/detecting-parameters-change) is also easily achieved.

It is also possible to create [alert conditions](http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation/alerts), and get notified via [email](http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation/emails) on raised or resolved alerts.

Please refer to the [documentation](http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation) for further discussion, (or just use the [Quick HOWTO](http://code.openark.org/forge/mycheckpoint/documentation/quick-howto))
